Isaac Mooney - February, 2018

This directory contains the analysis for the data-driven correction (hence "ddc") on matched jets in Pythia8.

The goal of this project is to investigate the feasibility of a novel unfolding procedure in which, rather than a pythia prior, one uses available detector-level information in data - namely, the tracking efficiency and the detector-level constituent spectrum - to correct back to particle-level. The first investigation was done on a toy model which is also on my GitHub page (repository: Toy-Closure-Test). It was demonstrated that a folding of the particle-level leading-jet track multiplicity with the (eta-averaged) STAR efficiency is quite well-modeled by a Poisson distribution with reasonable parameters. I then began a more realistic study in Pythia8 by geometrically matching particle-level and detector-level jets from the same event, first after applying a flat tracking efficiency of 80%, then with STAR's 2007 pp efficiency. Either may be selected in the code via command line arguments.

There remains much work to be done. I plan to:
      1) Add momentum smearing
      2) Add tracks back according to the radial profile distribution of the jets
      3) Determine an appropriate parameter in the Poisson number loss distribution by folding the constituent spectrum with the efficiency distribution

Important directories and files:
	  *Be sure to run mkdir for out/, bin/, lib/, and src/obj/, in the efficiency/ directory, and bin/, results/, and src/obj/, in the main directory.
	  *efficiency/ contains the necessary material to make the STAR efficiency shared library - except for a root file which I have not uploaded (my email is fs3383@wayne.edu).
	  *src/ contains the matched jet analysis in the files "ddc_matched.cxx", "analysis_funcs.cxx", and "analysis_funcs.h".
	  *bins.cmnd in the main directory is read in by the analysis in order to stitch together 11 Pythia pT hard-bins from 5 to 60 GeV (currently).
	  *out/ contains many TTree analyzers. The analysis may be run in "fat" mode (run the program with a -h flag for more information) which produces a much more comprehensive output root file. These TTree analyzers are useful for analyzing those trees. However, I haven't used them since I had Root5, so they are possibly deprecated. They also will need to have file paths/names updated.
	  *matchedjetdiffs.C is the macro which runs the corrections on the matched jets once they've been matched via bin/ddc_matched
	  *plotting_diffs.C is the plotting macro.
